Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,嘿！铃鼓先生，为我奏一曲

Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,尽管我知道，黄昏的帝国早已归於尘土
Vanished from my hand,自我的掌心消逝
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.留下我盲然在此伫立，却了无困意
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,我惊奇於自己的倦乏，我的双足俱已烙印
I have no one to meet此地无人可遇
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.古远旷废的街道又过份死寂，不宜梦想

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,带我登上你魔样涡漩的帆船开始旅程吧
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,我的知觉已被剥去，我的双手无法握紧
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels足趾麻木难以起步，仅仅等待我的靴跟
To be wanderin'.游荡徘徊
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade无论如何我已准备离去，我已经打算消失
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,匿身自己的行伍，对我施下你的舞咒蛊惑我的道路吧

Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly,尽管你也许听见笑声，旋转著、疯狂地摆荡
across the sun,越过烈阳
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run那并不针对任何人，只是漫长路途逸出的声响
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.若非为了蓝天，也不会有围墙阻挡
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme要是你还听见模糊的印迹，韵脚跳跃旋转
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,与你的铃鼓唱和，那只是跟在身后，一个衣衫褴褛的小丑
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're我并不在意，他捕捉的，只是
Seein' that he's chasing.你眼中的一抹影子

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.在这铿锵作响的早晨让我与你同去
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,然后带我消失罢，穿过我意识中的烟圈
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,沈入时光深处雾气氤氲的废墟，远远越过冻僵的寒叶
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,穿出阴森悚栗的林木，来到多风的沙滩
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.与狂乱伤悲的扭曲界域，遥遥隔开
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free是的，在钻石的天空下起舞，一只手自在地挥呀挥
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,侧影反衬著海水，四周是圆场的黄沙
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,带著一切记忆与命运，一齐潜入翻涌的波涛之下
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.且让我忘记今日直到明天来临

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.我尚未入眠，且无处可归
